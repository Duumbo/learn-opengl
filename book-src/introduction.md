# Introduction

This is a book, well, "book", about learning OpenGL usage with Rust.

It's based on [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com/), by Joey de Vries,
which is for C++ OpenGL. I'm not associated with Joey at all, I just think that
they made a cool thing and I want to spread the knowledge to Rust folks as well.

OpenGL (OGL), is one particular flavor of GL within the larger GL family.
There's also OpenGL ES (GLES), which is for embedded systems like phones and
raspberry pi, and there's WebGL which is for GL in the browser.

I don't expect that I will write all the lesson text well enough in the first
draft for it to be a stand alone teaching method. Please file issues in the
github repo when something is confusing.

However, the code itself will compile and work of course, so if you
look at the code and read the pages here and the pages there it'll hopefully
make some sense when you add it all up.

Sorry, but books like this are kinda difficult to write properly, 
and I want to put more focus on getting out working examples than on
having perfect tutorial text.
